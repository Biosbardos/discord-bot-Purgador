# discord-bot-Purgador

Thanks to JSDoc and to Github Pages, this repository now includes online documentation: [discord-bot-Purgador Documentation](https://biosbardos.github.io/discord-bot-Purgador/).

IMPORTANT REMINDER: Due to the significant effort involved in keeping the JSDoc-generated documentation up to date with every commit to the main branch, documentation updates will only be committed during the release of new stable versions. Additionally, please note that only the main branch will be documented. Other branches will be included once they are merged.
